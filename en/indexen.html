    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <div class="about-container">
      <div class="about-text">
          <p>
            I believe true personal growth and professional development arise from diverse experiences, curiosity, and the courage to explore the unknown. Openness to new challenges has shaped my life and career approach: during high school, I participated in numerous projects that developed creative, intellectual, and organizational skills. I competed in national Serbian language competitions, placing among the top three participants three times for essays on historical figures and creative expression topics, edited the school e-magazine, and managed school news, while simultaneously developing skills through acting and culinary sections. A notable project in Management involved independently creating a brochure – a tourist guide for Despotovac municipality, preparing texts, photos, and visual materials, which earned me first place in a local competition and demonstrated how dedication and precision can yield excellent results. Combining professional experience, versatile skills, leadership abilities, communication proficiency, and openness to new experiences allows me to approach each project with passion, innovation, and dedication, leaving a positive and lasting impact in the communities I engage with.
          </p>
          <p>
            Although initially shy and uneasy with public speaking, experience and interaction with people have enabled me to gradually open up, expressing ideas with confidence, clarity, and authenticity.

        <div class="info-card">
          <h3></h3>
          <div class="info-card-text">
            <p>I have been actively involved in design for two months, during which I founded my own studio and started working independently. Although the start was short, interest and demand for my services quickly emerged, giving me additional confidence and motivation to continue building my professional path.

I approach each project with dedication, eagerness to learn, and constant knowledge improvement. I believe in quality work, clear communication, and responsibility—values on which I build my studio and long-term collaborations.</p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="info-card">
          <h3>Work Experience</h3>
          <div class="info-card-text">
            <p>My professional journey reflects the same passion and curiosity. As a Tourist Guide in Resava Cave, I led groups of over 2,000 visitors during holiday periods, created promotional materials, wrote texts about the cave, designed brochures, managed social media, and actively handled ticket sales. My desire to explore new areas led me to the world of flavors – as a Bartender I experimented with cocktail techniques and developed innovative flavors, before discovering latte art and starting work as a Barista, which improved precision, aesthetics, and customer interaction. Simultaneously, through my Design Studio, I honed project management, creative concept development, and idea implementation skills, while independently learning web coding.</p>
          </div>
        </div> 
        <div class="info-card">
          <h3>My Goal</h3>
          <div class="info-card-text">
            <p>My ultimate goal reflects the belief that knowledge and resources should be accessible to everyone: I want to create a village where all homeless people can live with dignity and eat for free weekly, as well as engage in educational initiatives – providing free books to children of single mothers and funding their schooling, giving opportunities for growth and development to those who need help most.</p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="info-card">
          <h3>Education</h3>
          <div class="info-card-text">
            <p>I completed high school at the Technical School in Despotovac, majoring in Tourism and Hotel Management, and in the Oxford admission test (Philological English program) I was among the top three candidates with 90 points. Although I did not continue formal university education, I chose to develop through practical experience and independent creation, with a clear vision to create projects reflecting values, creativity, and professional autonomy.</p>

  <h2>Trivia - All About Me</h2> 
  <p style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 60px; font-size: 18px; max-width: 800px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; line-height: 1.6; color: #000;">
    Versatility and a curious spirit are the essence of my identity. Photography, drawing, writing, cooking, manicure, tattooing, and self-piercing are part of my expression and areas where I have explored myself, developing precision, patience, and innovative thinking. I pay special attention to studying different cultures and traditions, reading literature, and watching documentaries that deepen understanding of the world, customs, and values, strengthening my ability to adapt and succeed in multicultural environments. Besides Serbian and English, I started learning basic Korean but could not continue due to guiding work and time constraints; my wish was to expand communication horizons.

          <h3>MONASTERIES</h3>
          <p>I love visiting monasteries, local churches, and monastery viewpoints – within the monasteries, which provide peace and inspiration. I often visit them during holidays or Sundays, enjoying the silence.</p>

          <h3>HIKING</h3>
          <p>I enjoy hiking and visiting viewpoints, as being in nature brings me peace and new energy. Every ascent I see as an opportunity to distance myself from daily life and observe things from a different perspective.</p>

          <h3>LANDMARKS</h3>
          <p>I enjoy visiting local, cultural, and natural landmarks I haven't seen before. My goal is to first visit all of Serbia, and I have already explored a significant part of its beauty.</p>

          <h3>ANIMALS</h3>
          <p>I particularly love animals — both domestic and exotic. Over time, I have had various pets, including a Vietnamese pot-bellied pig, a crab, a guinea pig, and several other exotic species.</p>

          <h3>COOKING</h3>
          <p>I love exploring local flavors and trying traditional specialties from the places I visit. Every meal is part of a cultural experience and an opportunity to learn about local customs and traditions. My favorite dish comes from Bajina Bašta — roasted kajmak, which I always especially enjoy.</p>

          <h3>NATURE</h3>
          <p>I love nature and believe it is important to protect, recycle, and avoid harming it. My favorite tree is the weeping willow, reminding me of the school park and abstract graffiti around it, which inspired the idea for the Design Studio.</p>

          <h3>FASHION</h3>
          <p>I love fashion, especially the autumn edition, when I can combine coats, layered clothing, and stylish hats. Autumn gives me the perfect chance to experiment with colors, materials, and details, creating outfits that are both elegant and comfortable.</p>

          <p>I particularly enjoy landscapes — observing, photographing, and drawing them. I often find inspiration in nature through photos and writing topics and posts dedicated to the natural environment.</p>

          <h3>TARA</h3>
          <p>My favorite mountain is Tara, where I enjoy every moment in winter. I love seeing deer and friendly locals. Tara is busy, but it has retained its authentic character, which is why I gladly return every winter to this national park.</p>

          <h3>RESAVA CAVE</h3>
          <p>I spent a year as a tourist guide in Resava Cave, which helped me overcome stage fright. After that, I worked in marketing, creating brochures for the cave, where I discovered my passion for design and visual material creation.</p>

          <h3>VELIKI KRŠ</h3>
          <p>I'm not a big fan of summer tourism, but I enjoy visiting mountains in summer, especially Veliki Krš and the surrounding area. I also enjoy spending summer at Gružansko Lake, where locals are always very friendly.</p>

          <h3>ART</h3>
          <p>I love artworks on canvas, as I find inspiration and expression that words often cannot describe. Each canvas tells its own story, colors, and emotions, and I enjoy observing every detail shaping a unique artistic vision.</p>

          <p>My favorite nearby travel destination is Bosnia, especially Mostar, for its unique atmosphere and colorful streets.
