    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <div class="about-container">
      <div class="about-text">
          <p>
            I believe that true personal development and professional growth come from diverse experiences, curiosity, and the courage to explore the unknown. Openness to new challenges has shaped my life and career approach: during high school, I participated in numerous projects that developed creative, intellectual, and organizational skills. I competed in national Serbian language competitions, placing among the top three participants three times for essays on historical figures and creative topics, edited the school electronic magazine, and managed school news, while also developing skills in acting and culinary arts. A notable project was within Management, where I independently created a brochure – a tourist guide for Despotovac municipality, prepared texts, photos, and visual materials, which won first place in a local competition and showed me how dedication and precision bring great results. The combination of professional experience, versatile skills, leadership abilities, communication proficiency, and openness to new experiences allows me to approach every project with passion, innovation, and dedication, leaving a positive and lasting impact on the communities I work with.
          </p>
          <p>
            Although initially shy and uneasy with public speaking, experience and interaction with people allow me to gradually open up, expressing ideas with confidence, clarity, and authenticity.

        <div class="info-card">
          <h3></h3>
          <div class="info-card-text">
            <p>I have been actively working on design for two months, and during this period, I founded my own studio and began independent work. Although it was a short start, interest and demand for my services quickly appeared, giving me additional confidence and motivation to continue building my professional path.

I approach every project with great dedication, a desire to learn, and continuous skill improvement. I believe in high-quality work, clear communication, and responsibility – values upon which I build my studio and long-term collaborations.</p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="info-card">
          <h3>Work Experience</h3>
          <div class="info-card-text">
            <p>My professional journey reflects the same passion and curiosity. As a Tourist Guide in Resava Cave, I led groups of over 2,000 visitors during holiday periods, created promotional materials, wrote texts about the cave, designed brochures, managed social media, and handled ticket sales. My desire to explore new fields led me to experiment with flavors – as a bartender, I developed innovative cocktails, and later discovered latte art as a barista, improving precision, aesthetics, and customer interaction. In parallel, through my Design Studio, I honed project management skills, developed creative concepts, and implemented original ideas, while also teaching myself to code websites.</p>
          </div>

        <div class="info-card">
          <h3>My Goal</h3>
          <div class="info-card-text">
            <p>My ultimate goal reflects the belief that knowledge and resources should be accessible to everyone: I want to create a village where all homeless people can live with dignity and receive free meals every week, as well as act through educational initiatives – providing free books to children of single mothers and funding their education, offering opportunities for growth and development to those who need help most.</p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="info-card">
          <h3>Education</h3>
          <div class="info-card-text">
            <p>I completed high school at Technical School in Despotovac, Tourism-Hospitality Technician track, and in the Oxford entrance exam (Philology English program) I was among the top three candidates with 90 points. Although I did not continue formal university education, I chose to develop through practical experience and independent creation, with a clear vision to create projects that reflect values, creativity, and professional autonomy.</p>

    <h2>Trivia - All About Me</h2>
    <p style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 60px; font-size: 18px; max-width: 800px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; line-height: 1.6; color: #000;">
      Versatility and an investigative spirit define my identity. Photography, drawing, writing, culinary arts, manicure, tattooing, and self-piercing are part of my expression and the activities I explored, developing precision, patience, and innovative thinking. I pay special attention to studying different cultures and traditions, reading literature, and watching documentaries that deepen understanding of the world, customs, and values, enhancing my adaptability and success in multicultural environments. Besides Serbian and English, I started learning basic Korean but had to pause due to guiding work and time constraints; my goal was to expand communication horizons.

          <h3>HIKING</h3>
          <p>I love hiking and visiting viewpoints, as being in nature brings me peace and new energy. Every ascent is an opportunity to step away from daily life and see things from a different perspective.</p>

          <h3>NATURE</h3>
          <p>I love nature and believe it is important to protect it, recycle, and not harm it. My favorite tree is the weeping willow, which reminds me of my school park and the abstract graffiti art around it, inspiring the idea for Design Studio.</p>
